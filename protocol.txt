
PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION


> put <filename>
Sending file to server

Client sends one message to the server in the following format:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character P followed by
two-byte integer value in two's compliment and in network byte order, which represents the length of the filename of the file to be sent to the server followed by
the sequence of ASCII characters representing the filename


Once the server receives a message with opcode P, it responds with the following message:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character P followed by
one byte acknowledgment code which is one of the following ASCII characters:
0 - the server is ready to accept the named file
1 - the server cannot accept the file as there is a filename clash
2 - the server cannot accept the file because it cannot create the named file
3 - the server cannot accept the file due to other reasons


Once the client receives the P message from the server and if the acknowledgment code is 0, it responds by sending the following message:

one byte opcode which is the ASCII character D followed by
four-byte integer, N, in two's compliment and in network byte order which represents the length of the file followed by
a sequence of N bytes which is the content of the file



> get <filename>
Receiving file from server

Client sends one message to the server in the following format:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character G followed by
two-byte integer value in two's compliment and in network byte order, which represents the length of the filename of the file to be sent from the server followed by
the sequence of ASCII characters representing the filename


Once the server receives a message with opcode G, and no error is encountered it responds with the following message:

one byte opcode which is the ASCII character D followed by
four-byte integer, N, in two's compliment and in network byte order which represents the length of the file followed by
a sequence of N bytes which is the content of the file


Once the server receives a message with opcode G, and an error is encountered it responds with the following message:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character G followed by
one byte acknowledgment code which is one of the following ASCII characters:
0 - the server cannot find requested file
1 - the server cannot send the file due to other reasons



> pwd
Receive the current directory path of the server

Client sends one message to the server in the following format:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character A


Once the server receives a message with opcode A it responds with the following message:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character A followed by
two-byte integer, N, in two's compliment and in network byte order which represents the length of the current directory path followed by
a sequence of N bytes which is the current directory path in ASCII



> dir
Receive the current directory list of file names on the server

Client sends one message to the server in the following format:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character B


Once the server receives a message with opcode B responds with the following message:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character B followed by
four-byte integer, N, in two's compliment and in network byte order which represents the length of the current directory listing followed by
a sequence of N bytes which is the current directory listing in ASCII



> cd
Change the current directory on the server

Client sends one message to the server in the following format:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character C
two-byte integer value in two's compliment and in network byte order, which represents the length of the directory name to change to
the sequence of ASCII characters representing the directory name


Once the server receives a message with opcode C responds with the following message:

one byte opcode which is ASCII character C followed by
one byte acknowledgment code which is one of the following ASCII characters:
0 - the server changed directory succussfully
1 - the server cannot find the directory
2 - the server cannot change directory due to other reasons
